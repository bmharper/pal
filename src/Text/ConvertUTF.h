     Conversions between UTF32, UTF-16, and UTF-8.  Header file.

     Several funtions are included here, forming a complete set of
     conversions between the three formats.  UTF-7 is not included
     here, but is handled in a separate source file.

     Each of these routines takes pointers to input buffers and output
     buffers.  The input buffers are const.

     Each routine converts the text between *sourceStart and sourceEnd,
     putting the result into the buffer between *targetStart and
     targetEnd. Note: the end pointers are *after* the last item: e.g.
     *(sourceEnd - 1) is the last item.

     The return result indicates whether the conversion was successful,
     and if not, whether the problem was in the source or target buffers.
     (Only the first encountered problem is indicated.)

     After the conversion, *sourceStart and *targetStart are both
     updated to point to the end of last text successfully converted in
     the respective buffers.

     Input parameters:
     sourceStart - pointer to a pointer to the source buffer.
         The contents of this are modified on return so that
         it points at the next thing to be converted.
     targetStart - similarly, pointer to pointer to the target buffer.
     sourceEnd, targetEnd - respectively pointers to the ends of the
         two buffers, for overflow checking only.

     These conversion functions take a ConversionFlags argument. When this
     flag is set to strict, both irregular sequences and isolated surrogates
     will cause an error.  When the flag is set to lenient, both irregular
     sequences and isolated surrogates are converted.

     Whether the flag is strict or lenient, all illegal sequences will cause
     an error return. This includes sequences such as: <F4 90 80 80>, <C0 80>,
     or <A0> in UTF-8, and values above 0x10FFFF in UTF-32. Conformant code
     must check for illegal sequences.

     When the flag is set to lenient, characters over 0x10FFFF are converted
     to the replacement character; otherwise (when the flag is set to strict)
     they constitute an error.

     Output parameters:
     The value "sourceIllegal" is returned from some routines if the input
     sequence is malformed.  When "sourceIllegal" is returned, the source
     value will point to the illegal value that caused the problem. E.g.,
     in UTF-8 when a sequence is malformed, it points to the start of the
     malformed sequence.

/** Returns the maximum number of UTF8 bytes necessary in order to represent any legal UTF16 string of the indicated number of UTF16 characters.

    Maximum length of a UTF8 sequence is 4 bytes.
    Maximum length of a UTF16 sequence is 2 bytes.
    Therefore, when converting a UTF16 string to UTF8, in order to be safe against any possible inputs, you must allocate
    N * 4 bytes, where N is the number of 16-bit characters. However, 4 byte UTF8 sequences are only necessary for values
    of 0x10000 and greater. Likewise, UTF16 pairs are only necessary for values greater than or equal to 0x10000. So,
    for values less than 0x10000, we have the maximum number of UTF8 bytes equal to N * 3. For values greater than or
    equal to 0x10000, we need (N/2) * 4 = N * 2. So the maximum number of bytes necessary is N * 3.
