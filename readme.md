This is my personal Platform Abstraction Library for C++.

It has things inside it which are definitely not a common platform thing, but meh!

I'm just so sick of recreating these things for different projects, that I've
decided to publish a snapshot of this PAL as an open source library, so that
I don't have to recreate this for every new C++ project that I start.
